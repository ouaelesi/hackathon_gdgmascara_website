Aztics is a team of creative engineering students <br> who believe that the best way to learn is to find<br> the right person to guide you and answer your <br>questions rather than spending too much time<br> on following classic courses without making real <br>progress. Our mission is to help
students and the<br> community to be more productive and motivated<br> about exchanging informations,  and to give the<br> chance for professionals to share their knowledge<br> with the learners.  <br>By simplifying the learning process and making  <br>it more interactive, e-learning has never <br> been this fun before.
